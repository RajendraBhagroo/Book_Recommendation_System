    Rajendra Bhagroo:
        I have personally watched and implemented all 6hrs, 23mins, 51s of Corey Schafers Django tutorial series on Youtube.
        I have attempted to use Django previously from the documentation, however visually seeing the tutorials
        helped me understand how to use this framework and better understand the Django documentation.
